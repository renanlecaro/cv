# Very simple resume generator

Like every front end dev and their mother, I created a tiny html doc to generate my resume's pdf.
I'm keeping it in the repo to always have it at hand.

I'm making it public to let you reuse the code if you feel like it. 
It has some nice features you might like :

- very minimal system with direct html editing
- clean black and white design
- print friendly css (see the `<style>` tag)
- multilingual : see the `<scritp>` tag for configuration, duplicated element and add an attribute like [fr](https://lecaro.me/cv/?fr) or [en](https://lecaro.me/cv/?en)
